If a single sheet is used, one obtains a single-walled nanotube (SWNT), while several nested SWNTs give a multi-walled nanotube (MWNT), a double-walled nanotube (DWNT) being a special case of these. These all-carbon macromolecules are known to have superb mechanical (e.g. Young modulus of ~1TPa and tensile strengths up to 53GPa), electrical (e.g. ballistic conduction and current carrying capacities up to 4x10 9A/cm2), and thermal (e.g. thermal conductivity of 3500W/mK along the tube axis) properties.\nIn 2004, a unique method for the continuous production of CNT fibres and films was developed by Prof. Alan Windle\u0026rsquo;s group 1, part of the MML. In this method, an “elastic CNT smoke” is formed in the CVD reaction zone of a vertical furnace in which a carbon source is decomposed in the presence of floating iron catalyst particles in a reducing atmosphere. This smoke can be pulled out of the reactor and continuously wound onto a spool – a process somewhat similar to making candy-floss. Winding the material up without any further densification results in a CNT film. Alternatively, the material may be densified into a yarn-like fibre by an in-line process in which a solvent is sprayed on it, generating capillary forces that significantly reduce its diameter. Fibres made by this method already show mechanical properties comparable to those of high performance fibres such as Kevlar and Dyneema, with much better resistance to bending and knotting. They also show vastly superior electrical conductivities compared with carbon fibre and have an axial thermal conductivity of 1250 W/m.K which is some three times that of copper or 25 times better per unit weight.\nIn the MML group we keep working on perfecting our synthesis method, aiming for electrical conductivities capable of challenging copper and mechanical properties closer to those of individual CNTs. We also investigate the use of our fibres and films to make multifunctional composite materials.\nOver the past decade MML has developed a unique process for synthesizing carbon nanotubes via the floating catalyst route, and at the same time winding the entangled aerogel into a fibre. The process will work with a variety of different carbon feedstocks and generates a fibre with axial properties in the Kevlar range, but great robustness in bending.\nIt is thus possible to convert natural gas continuously into a high tech fibre in a single reactor. Current focus of the work is the improvement of mechanical, electrical and thermal properties for a wide range of applications, some of them multifunctional. Part of this activity is through enhanced control of the spinning process itself, other approaches rely on post spinning processes such as chemical functionalization of the fibre and heat and radiation treatments. The fibre’s unique mechanical robustness stems from the fact that it is a nanoscale yarn, which also means that when incorporated in composites, the matrix penetrates the fibre providing unique level of bonding with the matrix.\nY.-L.

Our aim is to produce composites of tailored properties and functionality: from nanotube loaded polymers for static dissipation to multifunctional composite fibres for smart textiles.\nComposite materials are made up of at least two distinguishable phases – usually called matrix and reinforcement – each with different physical and/or chemical properties. A matrix is a continuous phase that holds together one or several reinforcements; reinforcements are discrete particles or fibres that enhance the material\u0026rsquo;s properties (e.g. mechanical strength, electrical and thermal conductivities, abrasion resistance). Synergistic interactions between matrix and reinforcement(s) give composites properties not available from their separate constituents. An example of a natural composite is wood, in which cellulose fibres reinforce a lignin matrix; synthetic composites include concrete, plywood, and the advanced fibre-reinforced polymers used in aerospace and sports applications.\nThe Macromolecular Materials Laboratory focuses mainly on composites of which one of their phases consists of carbon nanotubes (CNTs): from CNT-reinforced polymers, in which the nanotubes are dispersed in the matrix to enhance the material\u0026rsquo;s strength and electrical conductivity, to composite fibres and films, in which a macroscopic CNT assembly acts as a porous matrix capable of holding large amounts of powders or continuous coatings that lend functionality to the material (e.g. superconductivity, actuation, catalysis, and sensing). We rely on a series of computational and characterisation techniques – including multiscale modeling, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray scattering (SAXS, WAXS), electron microscopy (SEM, HRTEM), mechanical testing (Favimat, DMA), and thermal analysis (TGA, DSC) – to investigate matrix-reinforcement interactions and structure-property relations in our composites.

This has the advantages of being both quicker and cheaper than a trial-and-error experimentation process, and also yields detailed structural and dynamical information that can provide a stringent test of theoretical models.\nAs computing power continues to increase at a relentless pace, it is tempting to consider the simulation of large and/or complex systems using brute force atomistic simulation methods alone. However, even extrapolating from current state-of-the-art methodologies, it would still take well over a century of exponential growth in computing resources to achieve parity with ‘real time’ simulations of experimental systems of macroscopic size and, in any case, the sheer amount of data produced would overwhelm any attempt at detailed scientific analysis. Therefore, it is imperative that we now seek to exploit the regions of overlap between well-established techniques for electronic structure calculations, molecular dynamics, mesoscopic simulations and continuum modelling to allow efficient multiscale simulations of increasingly complex condensed phase systems. Multiscale modelling is currently a powerful and widely-used tool in Materials Science, in which there have been significant technical and scientific advances over the last decade, enabling novel fields of application from nanotechnology to biomineralization.\nIn the MML group we utilise simulation techniques across all of the length scales above. At the electron scale, density functional theory and Hartree-Fock methods are used to calculate parameters ab initio. Expertise in using Materials Studio, CHARMM, AMBER, VMD, NAMD, LAMMPS, DL_POLY and many more force fields and simulation packages allow us to simulate molecular systems. In the mesoscale, coarse-grained molecular dynamics and dissipative particle dynamics are used to simulate even larger systems on timescales more comparable with experiments. Finally at the macroscopic scale the discrete element method and finite element method allow us to simulate processes which the naked eye can see.\n","permalink":"//conorwilliams.github.io/mml/research/modelling/","summary":"With modern computational techniques, it is now possible to predict the properties of novel materials from first principles using advanced simulation techniques.

Issues including processing history and storage conditions have an effect on the properties of the particles leading to changes in how granular systems respond to external stimuli.\nResearch into granular materials within the MML group contains good variety. Flow and adhesion properties of toner and carrier particles in a printer are of interest. This binary system requires particle interactions to allow for the fine toner particles to adhere to the bulkier carrier particles for deposition on the printed paper, whilst allowing carrier particles to be reused and preventing toner particles from forming clumps. The ring shear testing technique was used to investigate the flow properties of both model and real toner-carrier particle systems.\nPharmaceutical powders are also a current research area, especially when compacted to form tablets. The use of computational modelling and compaction simulators to investigate tablet production is of current interest. Computational simulations using quantum theory and molecular dynamics allow for investigations into the material properties of the powder. The discrete element method and the finite element method, in conjunction with the Drucker-Prager cap model can simulate entire pharmaceutical powder systems.

It uses a vibroscopic method to determine the fibre’s linear density and a very sensitive load cell to measure strength and stiffness. Using specific properties (properties divided by density) allows us to compare our direct-spun CNT and nanocomposite-fibres against commercially-available high-performance fibres.\nRaman spectroscopy The Raman effect is a scattering phenomenon that provides chemical and structural information: the wavelength shifts between incident and inelastically scattered photons correspond to the energies of different molecular vibration modes. Raman spectroscopy can be applied in a wide range of materials – from pharmaceuticals to semiconductors – and is one of the most useful techniques for characterising carbon nanotubes (providing information about diameter, chirality, and defects), grapheme, and other, carbon-based, nanomaterials. The MML proudly owns a Bruker Senterra, providing measurements with different laser wavelengths and the possibility of automated 3D mapping (Raman intensity over 2D sample area).\nPolymer characterisation laboratory We have access to the department’s polymer characterisation laboratory which includes, amongst others, equipment for differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), evolved gas analysis (EGA), and infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). We use these techniques to study several properties of our nanostructured composite materials.\nX-ray scattering techniques Having access to the departmental X-ray facilities we’re able to study the structure of our nanomaterials (powders, fibres, or films) and composites reinforced with them. For us, one of the most useful pieces equipment is the Bruker Nanostar Gen7, capable of collecting both wide- and small-angle patterns (WAXS and SAXS) which probe the structure of our CNT fibres at the inter- and intrabundle levels, respectively; the device has also been used to study the effects of solvents on collagen and other macromolecules.\nElectron microscopy The group has access to the multiple electron microscopy facilities of the department, including scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) equipped with a focused ion beam (FIB) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and transmission electron microscopes (TEMs). SEM is one of the basic methods to get a first impression of the structure of a sample, while FIB provides the possibility to cut cross-sections and look – e.g. inside our spun CNT fibres – or to prepare thin samples for TEM. In the case of carbon nanotubes, TEM is mainly used to analyse, either by imaging or by electron diffraction, characteristics such as wall number and diameter, and defects or impurities present.\nElectrical characterisation equipment We have several house-built two- and four-point circuits and a Solartron ModuLab capable of performing frequency response, high voltage cell polarization, and low current measurement measurements. With these devices we can characterise the electrical properties of nanocomposites and assemblies of carbon nanotubes under several conditions (immersed in liquids, controlled humidity, varying temperature).\nOther characterisation equipment For a full list of the facilities available to us, please visit the Department of Materials Science \u0026amp; Metallurgy website.\n","permalink":"//conorwilliams.github.io/mml/research/charachterisation/","summary":"The Macromolecular Materials Laboratory either owns or has access to top-of-the-line equipment for characterising a wide range of physical (mechanical, thermal, electrical, structural) properties of nanomaterials.

OpenFLY provides C++17/20 libraries and programs to build/run massively-parallel on-the-fly KMC simulations. It draws inspiration from the molecular dynamics packages [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org) and KMC package [HOOMD-blue](https://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/)

The source-code and documentation is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/ConorWilliams/openFLY).

Hi! I started my PhD in 2020, my research is focused on developing off-lattice kinetic Monte Carlo methods to enable the simulation of solid-state systems into extended timescales. I'm a self-proclaimed C++ addict, you can find out about some of my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/ConorWilliams).

### Ben Seddon

I started my PhD in 2019, just before the pandemic. It's been swell.

I had my undergraduate degree at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, where I studied Pure and Industrial Chemistry. After this, I undetook an Erasmus Mundus joint master degree course in Chemical Nanoengineering with semester rotations in France, Poland and Italy. I wrote my master thesis on the chemical functionalisation of nanosilica with aminosilane in supercritical carbon dioxide for the preparation of starch-nanosilica composites. My PhD at the University of Cambridge started in October 2022 and I am studying bipolymer composites for food packaging applications. Specifically, I am looking at films of cellulose nanofiber (CNF) from lignocellulosic biomass, their chemical modification and composites with other biomaterials such as proteins. Ultimately, the aim is to develop plastics whose chemical, mechanical and gas barrier properties are at least comparable to those of their oil-based counterparts used in food packaging. These materials will have the added advantage of being biodegradable and/or compostable at the end of their useful life.

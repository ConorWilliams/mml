Hi! I started my PhD in 2020, my research is focused on developing off-lattice kinetic Monte Carlo methods to enable the simulation of solid-state systems into extended timescales. I'm a self-proclaimed C++ addict, you can find out about some of my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/ConorWilliams).

I started my PhD in 2019, just before the pandemic. It's been swell.

My PhD started in October 2022 and I am studying bipolymer composites for food packaging applications. Specifically, I am looking at cellulose nanofiber (CNF) films, their chemical modification and composites with other materials such as proteins. Ultimately, the aim is to develop materials whose chemical, mechanical and gas barrier properties are at least comparable to those of their oil-based composites used in single-use packaging of food. These materials will have the added advantage of being biodegradable and compostable at the end of their useful life.

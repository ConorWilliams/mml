Hi! I started my PhD in 2020, my research is focused on developing off-lattice kinetic Monte Carlo methods to enable the simulation of solid-state systems into extended timescales. I'm a self-proclaimed C++ addict, you can find out about some of my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/ConorWilliams).
